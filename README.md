# Leaflet.Marker.SlideTo

A plugin for [LeafletJS](http://www.leafletjs.com) to fade out grid layers when removed.

Tested with Leaflet 1.0.0-rc3. Do not expect this to work in Leaflet 0.7.x.

See the [demo](http://ivansanchez.gitlab.io/Leaflet.GridLayer.FadeOut/demo.html).

### API

This Leaflet plugin is completely transparent, and adds no extra methods or options.

To use it, simply make sure that you have some gridlayers / tilelayers that are removed from the map. This can be done by using a layers control with several base layers.

### Installation through `npm`

```
npm install leaflet.gridlayer.fadeout
```

### Usage through unpkg

```
<script src='https://unpkg.com/leaflet.gridlayer.fadeout@0.1.0/Leaflet.GridLayer.FadeOut.js'></script>
```
